# Back to School

If you are like me, then its probably been more than a decade since you stepped out of school.
Like a zillion things we all learn at school but do not use in day to day life/work, our knowledge/skill on those areas gets rusted.

This repository is an attempt to revisit some Computer Science programming fundamentals that fall in the above category.  
All implementations are in Java.

As in life, here too, in this endeavor, I have a friend/mentor who is helping me shake off the rust.
In due course of time, with his permission, his identity may be revealed here.
He is the best teacher I have come across till now.
